# 🙂 Hi there I am Manish 👋

I am a Data Science and Analytics enthusiast and experienced pharma consulting professional. I have learned data science formally in classroom program "Data Science-Prodegree" from Imarticus Learning in collaboration with Genpact. Subject matter expertise in pharma/Lifesciences (proven by master’s degree in pharmacy and work experience) and my programming/AI/DS/ML skillsets makes me different and potential candidate for data science roles with ability to bridge gap between business side and technical side.
